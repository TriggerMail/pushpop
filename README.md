# pushpop
This is the repo to use pushpop to send alerts.

Pushpop is a framework for scheduled integration between services.  We can use it to query against keen, and generate alerts to send to slack or pagerduty.
The service is written in Ruby.  The official link is: http://pushpop.keen.io/.  Some useful links are:
